= The Definitive Guide to Spring Batch

Spring Batch is a lightweight, comprehensive batch framework designed to enable the development of robust batch applications vital for the daily operations of enterprise systems.
Spring Batch builds upon the productivity, POJO-based development approach, and general ease of use capabilities people have come to know from the [Spring Framework](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework), while making it easy for developers to access and leverage more advanced enterprise services when necessary.

This code repository is the source code for the book The Definitive Guide to Spring Batch by Michael Minella.
